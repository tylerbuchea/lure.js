			<p>
				The View is created when the
				model-data is merged with a template.
			</p>

			<p>
				Lure.js uses Handlebars for
				template interpolation.
				Handlebars is a very easy
				framework and you can 
				check out the API reference
				here <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com" target="_blank">Handlebars API</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Model and View are easy enough to understand. You may already
				be practicing these methods if you pull your data from a database
				and then use something like Crockford's "supplant" or even Handlebars
				to inject your data into a template.
			</p>

			<p>
				If your data never changed this would be all the info you'd need. But 
				users like to interact with things. Updating graphs, adding content,
				socializing, etc. This is where Controllers come in. They change the model
				in clever ways and then re-inject that data into the template to create the
				new view.

				Head over to the <a href="#/controller">Controller</a>
				section to understand the final letter of MVC.
