			<h2>Back Story</h2>			
			<p>				
				<a href="http://tylerbuchea.com" target="_blank">Tyler Buchea</a>
				created Lure.js
				to help him further understand
				how and why MVC frameworks had become
				so popular. He knew about the latest and greatest
				frameworks but trying to sift through their large
				repositories only hindered his comprehension. 
			<p>
				Without any good examples
				he set out to make his own MVC
				not only to learn himself, but to serve
				as a learning tool for other programmers
				who want a simplified explanation written
				in JavaScript.

			<h2>Requirements</h2>			
			<p>
				To keep Lure.js code lightweight and
				comprehensive it relies on third party
				libraries. You can check them out below
				for a better understanding of how to use
				Lure.js.
