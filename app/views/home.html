			<article x-link="#/model">
				<h2>Model</h2>
				<p>
				The model is the data which
				is merged with the template
				to produce the view.
				</p>
			</article>

			<hr />

			<article x-link="#/view">
				<h2>View</h2>
				<p>
				The view begins its life as 
				a template, is merged with the model, 
				and finally rendered into the browser DOM.
				</p>
			</article>

			<hr />

			<article x-link="#/controller">
				<h2>Controller</h2>
				<p>
				It&#8217;s job is to construct 
				the model and publish 
				it to the view.

			<h3>What is Lure.js?</h3>
			<article>
				<p>
				It is a tiny educational MVC framework written in JavaScript. What does that mean? It is an MVC framework written for JavaScript programmers that want to learn about MVC.
				</p>
				<p>
				The code is robust enough to be useful (in fact this site is using Lure.js). But small enough (~120 lines) for even a novice coder to read through and understand not only how an MVC is implemented but how a framework is constructed.

				See the <a href="#/about">about</a>
