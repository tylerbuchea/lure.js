				The Model is how you structure your data.
				You will create a hierarchy in the global 
				model object, so that it will merge nicely 
				with your templates.			
			</p>

			<p>
				Model is a global variable that all 
				controllers have access to.
				This is how data is shared throughout 
				your app.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Model will be merged with a
				template to create our
				next topic the <a href="#/view">View</a>.
